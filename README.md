## Background
BlockBreak was inspired off of Atari's classic game Breakout. It was written in JavaScript and uses Canvas for 2D rendering and as well as jQuery for DOM manipulation.
## How to Play
Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to ricochet the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, he or she will lose a life. The player has five lives to try to clear all of the bricks on each level.  For each brick hit, the player will receive a specific amount of points based on brick color and level. Ball speed increases at each level.  The goal of the game is to receive as many points as possible.
